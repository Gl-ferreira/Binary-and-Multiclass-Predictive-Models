# Examining Hospital Readmissions
Hospital Readmissions are challenging, since these increase hospital's costs and represent underperforming healthcare service. As such, in this Machine Learning project, we will use an hospital's dataset, to predict based on historical data, if someone will be readmitted. . In this project, we will produce two outputs: 
* a **Binary Classification**, that will tell us if a patient will be readmitted or not. 
* a **Multiclass Classification**, that will tell us if a patient will not be readmitted, if the patient will be readmitted within 30 days of the encounter or if the patient will be readmitted 30 days after the encounter.
